# Biomarker Discovery Workshop: Unraveling Insights from Omics Data

Welcome to the Biomarker Discovery Workshop! In this repository, we explore the fascinating world of biomarkers using omics data. Whether you're a researcher, a data enthusiast, or simply curious about the intersection of biology and data science, this workshop provides valuable insights.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Our goal is to identify potential biomarkers (genes, proteins, metabolites) associated with different subtypes of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a highly aggressive brain tumor.
- **Dataset**: We'll work with mRNA expression measurements from GBM tumors, which were previously published in *Cancer Cell*.
- **Approach**: We'll follow a data-driven pipeline, combining visualization, machine learning, and variable selection techniques.

## Workshop Steps

1. **Data Input and Visualization**:
   - Load the provided data.
   - Create essential visualizations to understand the dataset.

2. **Data Splitting**:
   - Divide the data into train and test sets.
   - Ensure robust model evaluation.

3. **Random Forest Model**:
   - Fit a basic random forest model using all training data.
   - Evaluate its performance on the test data.

4. **Variable Selection Rounds**:
   - Iteratively refine our biomarker candidates.
   - Use cross-validation to select informative features.

5. **Reduced Variable Model**:
   - Build a focused model with a reduced set of variables.
   - Assess its performance.

6. **Practice and Exploration**:
   - Deepen your understanding through practice.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Install R and RStudio.
   - Download the provided dataset files: `GlioblastomaExpressionData_Practical2.csv` and `GlioblastomaMetadata_Practical2.csv`.

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Save the downloaded files in your desired directory.
   - Set your working directory to this folder in RStudio.

3. **Start Coding**:
   - Open a new script in RStudio.
   - Save it in your chosen folder.
   - Begin your exploration!

## Acknowledgments

This workshop material is based on the original dataset published in *Cancer Cell*. We appreciate the contributions of the research community and the UK Biobank for making valuable data available.
